# Summary
I broke this homework into 4 parts
* Parse text file
* Get input from user [continuously]
* Find Occurrences
* Spit it out
---
## Parse text file
* Using a switch statemen, I built a character array consisting of every character in our text file that satisfied the requirements.
* My parse_file method took in a pointer to an array of 15,001 chars. This is where it stored the created array
* I learned the hard way that calling `sizeof(pointer)/sizeof(char)` on a pointer always returned 8 so I calloc'd my array so that I can find the length of it using `strlen()`
---
## Get input from user
* More or less just homework1
* I have a switch statement here too that checks whether the users input satisfies requirements.
* if it satisfies requirements, I create an array and pass that array to pattern_match
---
## Find Occurrences.
* my pattern_match is a pattern match with the pattern_match provided in the homework prompt
* I returned the offset rather than the total number of matches
---
## Spit it Out
* At the time of writing this, my code is real time. i.e it spits the locations of the pattern immediately after the user types a space character.
* I do not know if I will have enough time to change this. I'll try later on.
